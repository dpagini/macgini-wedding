								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you create a wedding website when your job is to work on websites all day? Yikes. Of course it was my responsibility. I wanted to do something easy. I wanted to do something fast. I wanted to do something that would look good. I work in <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> every day of my life, so it&#8217;s a logical choice, right? I went with WordPress. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f923.png" alt="ðŸ¤£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>This will get a bit technical, but it was a blast for me to set up, so I want to share some of the details:</p>
<h6>Domain Name</h6>
<p>First thing we needed was a domain name. You know, google.com, wikipedia.org, etc. It has to be catchy, and it has to be easy to say, spell and remember.&nbsp;<em>DaveAndRebecca</em> or <em>PaginiWedding</em> or&nbsp;<em>DaveRebe2019&nbsp;</em>were all the basic options. Rebecca suggested&nbsp;<em>Macgini</em> (obviously a mashup of our last names) and although I was reluctant to butcher my <em>flawless Italian last name</em>, it felt like the winner.</p>
<p>In general, I try to pay pennies for domain names. You can buy a year of a&nbsp;<em>.com</em> for somewhere in the $1 range for the first year, and maybe around $15/year going forward. We really only need this name for a year+. We could have went with the <em>MacginiWedding.com</em> domain, but not after I found out there&#8217;s a whole &#8220;.wedding&#8221; TLD (top level domain)!</p>
<p>So now I know I want&nbsp;http://macgini.davidpagini.com/, but GoDaddy wants $40/year for that domain! That was a bit steep when I could get the other one for a dollar, and (if you didn&#8217;t know this) I&#8217;m in the middle of planning for a wedding and need to save every dollar I can. Along came <a href="https://porkbun.com">porkbun.com</a>, maybe my favorite domain name ever, with that domain available for ~$20. In addition, I really like their services and will be using them as a first stop to buy domain names going forward.</p>
<p>So now I have a domain&#8230;</p>
<h6>Email</h6>
<p>I was all set to get up and running on Gmail for some wedding email. It turns out, Google changed their policies about 5 years ago and no longer allows for custom domains to use their business tools (Gmail, calendar, drive, etc.), so that was a huge bummer for me. I started looking around, and came across <a href="https://zoho.com">Zoho.com</a>. They let me set up 2 new email inboxes and a distribution list so we can keep all our wedding emails in one location. They even have a mobile app so we can get our email right from our phones, an absolute MUST for Rebecca.</p>
<h6>The Website</h6>
<p>All of the above is probably the bare minimum I would have done. I could have bought the domain name, and pointed to a <a href="https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites">Knot</a>&nbsp;customized website, and I&#8217;m sure I would have been frustrated by the lack of control, and they would have asked me to pay for&nbsp;<em>something,&nbsp;</em>but overall it would have been good enough.</p>
<p>I can never do something that simple, though; I had to do my own thing. I&#8217;ve created tons of websites over the years (<a href="http://grannybootlegs.freeservers.com/">some of which still run</a>, circa 2001), so I can say I&#8217;m comfortable with it. I like to try new services as well. I have, for the past few years, used Dreamhost to publish websites. I could pay ~$120/year, and publish just about as many hobby sites as I wanted to. I thought about using Github and the &#8220;github-pages&#8221; feature to host a static website (in fact, that was the first iteration of this domain). But in the spirit of trying something new, I wanted to give Amazon a spin.</p>
<p>I found this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-wordpress-website/">incredibly easy to follow guide</a> that resulted in a WordPress site up and running in under an hour. I spent a few days tweaking to my liking, and some time populating with content, such as this article you&#8217;re reading now.</p>
<p>So there you have it. A relatively brief retrospective of what it took, from a technology standpoint, to get this site up and running. I was most excited to play around with AWS tooling, and even tried a few things with Amazon Alexa. We&#8217;ll see what other fun things I can come up with over the next year of planning for our day.</p>

<p>We often get asked&nbsp;<em>how many weddings have we been</em>&nbsp;<em>to&nbsp;</em>and thought it would be fun to attempt to answer that. I know we&#8217;re going to miss some, but wanted to get a general idea by writing it down.</p>



<p>The answer is <del>52 as of August 2018, with 1 questionable and 4 coming soon</del> 55 as of February 2019, with 1 questionable and 2 coming soon. We should be at 57 before we get married. I&#8217;m actually a little surprised, the number was lower than I expected. Here&#8217;s the list, have fun! I think there&#8217;s a good chance we missed a few, so I apologize in advance!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I would imagine most folks know the story of how we met, but if anyone doesn&#8217;t, we enjoy telling it again. Officially, we met on May 12th, 2007, at the after party of our mutual friends&#8217; (Matt and Kristen Carabetta) wedding. Rebecca was a bridesmaid, and I was a hungover mess, just living my best 22nd year of life and going to a wedding the day after going to Boston for a Sox game (<em>Side note: I would die if I tried that these days&#8230;</em>). The late morning wedding had us celebrating well into the night at a house after-party in Wallingford. My friend Bobby and I took our liquid courage and struck up a conversation with 2 very attractive ladies in a garage. One of the first things Rebecca and I talked about wasÂ <em>who was tougher</em> between the two of us. To find the answer, we decided to have a 10-round ass-slapping (<em>pardon the langauge, but &#8220;spanking&#8221; was too suggestive and &#8220;butt slapping&#8221; just made me laugh</em>) competition. First one to &#8220;tap out&#8221; was the loser. Admittedly, I was the only one shrieking after each round, but ask Rebecca about who the winner was the next day.</p>
<p>As the night continued, Bobby, my ride, was ready to hit the road, but I thought I was the Fonz and had a good thing going here, so I asked the girls if they were hanging out longer if I could catch a ride home with them. They agreed. Rebecca, Nicole and I then went to Wal-Mart on the way home where I bought them both flowers and Pez dispenser, a true Casanova. They dropped me off at my parent&#8217;s house, and I wasn&#8217;t completely sure if I would see them again. Little did I know, I left something I bought at Wal-Mart in their car (honestly, I couldn&#8217;t even say this was on purpose, just a 2-straight days of drinking accident) and heard from Rebecca via a text message the next day. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>There are maybe a few more interesting things to note about our first few months together. We quickly realized that we knew MANY of the same people, and went to the same high school (I was a grade ahead of her), but we were shocked we never crossed paths before. That wasn&#8217;tÂ <em>completely</em> true, however. Our aforementioned mutual friend Kristen tells us of one such missed connection right out of a Craigslist post. If it were in Craigslist, it would read:Â <em>To the beautiful brunette who called me a &#8220;witch doctor&#8221; for no reason at Archie Moore&#8217;s last night, but we were both a little too intoxicated to remember, please give me another chance.</em>Â  Now we are getting married. It also took quite a bit of convincing before Rebecca would date me. I remember asking her by my girlfriend at least 3 times and being rejected beforeÂ <em>she finally asked me</em>. I guess I&#8217;m an acquired taste.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, yeah, I&#8217;ve heard it all&#8230; &#8220;It took too long&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s about time&#8221;, &#8220;What were you thinking?&#8221;. I don&#8217;t have answers to any of those, but I can only say that this day was always a foregone conclusion to me. We were both just having fun and building our lives together.</p>
<p>I had been seriously thinking about proposing for at least 3 years, but I am frankly a procrastinator. I also had a $50 bet with my friend Tim that he would get married before I did, a bet I cashed in on in April 2017 (although it still sits in the accounts receivable department) so I clearly had to outlast him. One day, I was sitting around and thinking about how we hadn&#8217;t had a &#8220;vacation&#8221; in a while and also had some free weekends in June coming up. I asked Rebe if she would be &#8220;ok&#8221; if I booked a weekend away, but where we were going was going to be a surprise. She agreed, and then badgered me for the next 5 weeks about where we were going.</p>
<p>On June 14th, 2018, we set off on a road trip to an unknown location. Rebe&#8217;s friends had all told her this was the weekend it would happen (but come on, how many times had that had of happened already?), and one particular friend, Justine, was beyond curious where we were headed. As we slowly hit the highways from I-691 to I-91N to I-84E, Justine was being relayed the information to research potential destinations. Rebecca right up front admitted her #1 guess was that we were headed South towards NYC, or more precisely to Coney Island, where there was a &#8220;Mermaid Parade&#8221; planned for the weekend, for which Rebecca packed her mermaid pants, t-shirt and makeup to ensure she would &#8220;fit in&#8221;. This made me laugh for at least 3 miles of our road trip. As we hit I-90, the girls were predicting a New Hampshire, Maine, Boston, Cape Cod destination, and when we went I-495S, Rebe got a text with a map of the Cape and surrounding mainland. I remained mum. About 5 miles outside of the Cape Cod bridges, she guessed Martha&#8217;s Vineyard, and the secret was out.</p>
<p>We took her car on the ferry across, and arrived at our Air BnB around 4pm. It was a studio apartment above a garage with a private entrance and parking space, a 5 star stay for sure. For the rest of the day, we explored downtown Edgartown and headed home a bit early in anticipation of a fun filled weekend. Now would be a good time to point out that I had ZERO plan for how our engagement might go down, and that of course added to all the nerves I had. So for the reset of the weekend, I decided to carry the ring with me in case the time was right. What a mental burden.</p>
<p>Friday was a little overcast, so we decided to be tourists and tour the whole island. In the morning we made our way out to Oaks Bluff and did some shopping and had lunch by the beach. We intended to try our hand at the brass ring carousel, but the hours were not kind to us. Our afternoon had us planning to head to Bad Martha&#8217;s Brewery, John Belushi&#8217;s grave site, Aquinnah Cliffs &amp; Gay Head Lighthouse, and Menemsha Beach for sunset. It was an awesome day, andÂ <em>could have been</em> the day we agreed to spend the rest of our lives together, if not for an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction. When we arrived at Larsen&#8217;s Fish Market on Menemsha Beach (notable as a Jaws filming location), I felt a bit of a breeze on my behind while walking around. I had a thread hanging and brushing my calf, and I thought it was a sand flea or some other nuisance. I soon realized thatÂ <em>somehow</em> my shorts had ripped from the back of my knee up to my belt buckle. Just half an hour before sunset, Rebe gave me the option of heading home or sticking it out. I grabbed my sweatshirt, tied it around my waist, and stuck it out for the rest of the night, and I am glad I did. If you haven&#8217;t been to Menemsha Beach for sunset, I have to recommend you put it on your list. We saw maybe <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BkELRcTlSVQZykT2DOXuiByKkteW1Ot1CIHtbA0/?taken-by=rrm625">one of the most beautiful sunsets</a> I have ever seen. It could have been a perfect proposal opportunity, if not for the fact that I was almost pantsless in front of about 75 onlookers. I was at leastÂ <em>slightly</em> worried I missed my chance.</p>
<p>We planned a trip to Chappaquiddick Island for Saturday, and took the &#8220;3 car 3 minute&#8221; ferry over to the island. Our first stop was the Mytoi gardens, a tranquil Japanese-style garden that was both peaceful andÂ exquisite. I gave more than a few thoughts to &#8220;popping the question&#8221; here, but I knew our next step was the nature reserve beaches at Wasque Point, and was hoping for <em>something even better</em>. When we got to the beaches, we found a trail we decided to walk down through this crazy woodsy area of trees that looked like they were out of a Lord of the Rings movie. The trail let out to the tops of a sand dune overlooking the Wasque Point beaches, and topped with an Osprey Nest. There was literally no one around except our friends, an osprey and her offspring. Rebecca was a bit caught up in the beauty, and being sure to capture it on her Instagram, it gave me some time to fetch the ring from my pocket. With no one in sight for probably a mile in either direction on one of the most beautiful yet touristy destinations on the entire East Coast, I got on one knee asked my best friend to marry me. I&#8217;m not sure if she said yes, but I already knew the answer and didn&#8217;t need to hear the words. We&#8217;re frankly both a little foggy on the details of the moment, yet it was an experience we will never forget, perfect in every way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Come away with us for the weekend!</p>
<p><span id="more-52"></span></p>
<p>We would love nothing more than for all of our friends &amp; family to come spend the whole late September weekend with us in Lakeville, CT. We specifically chose the Interlaken Inn for its &#8220;lake resort&#8221; feel in one of the most beautiful parts of our state.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Interlaken Inn</h2>
<p class="description">The year-round country resort is set on 30 beautiful acres nestled between two lakes in the Litchfield Hills of Connecticut. As a resort, our venue has a <strong>two night minimum</strong> for stays, and not at your typical Holiday Inn Express prices. We really think you will find value in your choice to stay with us though, and want to encourage everyone who has it within their means to consider staying with us here. We are planning on enjoying the entire weekend in Lakeville and there will be sure to be plenty of things to do all weekend. We would even suggest grabbing a friend and splitting the cost of a room with 2 queen beds! Or a big group (3-4 couples) in the townhouse suites for a better bang for your buck!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Please note that our block of rooms will only be available through March 20, 2019!!</em></strong></span> If you think you may want to book, consider putting a hold on a room. There is a $25 cancellation fee, but it may be better than missing out!</p>
<p class="address"><em>74 Interlaken Road, Lakeville, CT 06039</em></p>
<p class="phone">(800) 222-2909</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where and when are set! On Saturday, September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2019 in beautiful Lakeville, CT at the Interlaken Inn, Rebecca and I will say our &#8220;I do&#8217;s&#8221; overlooking Lake Wononskopomuc. <span id="more-46"></span><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-70" src="http://preview.macgini.wedding/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6920-300x225.jpg" alt="Dave &amp; Rebe visit the Interlaken for the first time." width="300" height="225" srcset="http://macgini.davidpagini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6920-300x225.jpg 300w, http://macgini.davidpagini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6920-768x576.jpg 768w, http://macgini.davidpagini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6920-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://macgini.davidpagini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6920-360x270.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We moved pretty quickly (in my opinion), but we were targeting next fall and knew we needed to book 12-14 months in advance. I usually get some agita over a decision like this, and need to research and measure 10 times before I cut once, but in this case, it was one of those <em>&#8220;when you know, you know&#8221;</em> situations (sort of like our relationship!).</p>
<p>We were both awe-struck by the beauty of this area, and the staff at Interlaken simply blew our socks off. We both had a vision of spending a weekend with our closest friends and family, and throwing one hell of a celebration, and we really could envision it happening here.</p>
